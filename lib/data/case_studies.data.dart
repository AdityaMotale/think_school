        "How Japan Revived its Economy to become a Developed Nation in just 23 years",

        """> Japan is one of the most incredible nations of the 21st Century, and while most of us know Japan as a fully developed country, what we don’t know is that in the 1940s, Japan faced every obstacle possible for its failure! They suffered a massive defeat in World War 2; the Hiroshima & Nagasaki bombing had shaken the spirits of the Japanese; they had very few natural resources and their economy was suffering one of it’s worst setbacks in history.

But within just 23 years, something crazy happened! Japan went on to become the second largest economy in the world, beating countries like France, Britain and even Russia. Japan is today known as the economic miracle of the 20th Century due to this incredible growth.

Japan as a nation was in complete ruins. Military forces were disbanded leaving 1.3 Crore people unemployed, the factories that supplied arms and goods to military lost business, the per capita GDP of the country dropped by 47% as compared to pre-war period, and the Industrial production reduced by 90%. As a result, there was hunger, starvation and poverty all across the country!

This is when the US occupied Japan, and empowered the government to revamp its economy! Japan had become an instrument for US control in Asia. It lost the right to have an army and was only allowed to have one for self defence purposes!

You will see that this translates into a billion dollar impact on the economy of the country.

Now the question is, if Japan was in ruins after World War, then how did these people find jobs? This was solved with the Keiretsu model!

This system is what gave rise to the most powerful Japanese companies in the world which we know today as Nippon Steel, Toyota and Mitsubishi.

What is so special about this system and how did it work?

If you look at how automobile companies operated in America back in the 1960s, you will see cut throat dealings and cost efficiency.

Eg. A giant car company like General Motors would have multiple suppliers and these suppliers would further have raw material suppliers.

No matter how many policies you come up with, if the people are complacent and don’t have the attitude to grow, the country will never progress. This difference in attitude could be very clearly seen with how government employees use or abuse their job security in Japan and India respectively.

You have the potential to change the future of your country as an individual. Decide for yourself what kind of citizen you want to be in the growth journey of India!

        """In the past 2 years, the ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ Industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in India.

What’s absolutely mind blowing is that the BNPL market is growing so fast, that it has achieved an insane growth rate of 569% in 2020 and 637% in 2021!

But on 20th of June 2022, the Reserve Bank of India made an announcement that shook the entire BNPL industry!

This notification disallowed non-bank prepaid wallets and prepaid cards from loading credit lines into these platforms.

First we need to understand how these Buy Now Pay Later companies make money and where they fit in the market.

If you look at the income and the ticket size of credit in the Indian market you will see that, while car loans are given to people with average income of 3 Lakhs per annum with a ticket size of 5–7 Lakhs, a credit card is issued to people with average incomes of more than 1.44 Lakhs per annum, with a limit of 25–50,000 rupees.

![Image 1](https://adityamotale.github.io/think_school_release/public/images/c_02_01.png)

In short, the ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ Industry stands on the foundation of India’s credit gap!
These BNPL services work just like a Credit Card EMI. If you are a student who wants to buy a pair of shoes for 3000 rupees, but then you have only 1500 rupees in your account and your pocket money is only 2000 rupees. You wouldn’t be able to purchase it.

So you can get your 2000 rupees of pocket money and pay 1000 rupees every month to settle your bill!

![Image 2](https://adityamotale.github.io/think_school_release/public/images/c_02_02.png)

Now the question is, if Slice charges you 0% interest, how do they make profits?

If you look at this transaction closely, you will realize that in spite of you being a student without a credit card, not having enough bank balance and having less pocket money, a pair of shoes worth 3000 rupees became affordable for you!

Just like yourself, those shoes became affordable for thousands of college students in the market. If previously only 100 rich kids in your college could buy those shoes, now 10,000 students in the college can afford them!

    "dateTime": "May 05, 2024",
    "category": "Business",
    "body":
        """> Maggi is one of the most iconic brands in Indian business history! It has been an integral part of our childhood! But from the business standpoint, the most fascinating thing about Maggi is that back in 1983, both Maggi and instant noodles were completely alien to the majority of Indians!

Nestlé single handedly created a 937 cr market and has been a market leader in the domain for 38 years! Despite giant rivals like ITC, Marico and Unilever, Maggi has a whooping 60% market share in the instant noodle segment!
The question is: How did Nestlé create a market for a seemingly alien dish in India?

How did establish a monopoly in the instant noodles market? And what are the lessons that we need to learn from the genius marketing strategy of Nestlé?

This is a story that dates back to 1950s Japan. During that time, the country was still recovering from the downfall of World War 2 and noodles were one of the most affordable foods in the market. It was during this time that a japanese man named Momofuku Ando created a type of noodles that could be prepared quickly and cheaply, making the revolutionary product that we know today as the Instant Ramen noodles!

During 1983, the pain point for mothers was offering their children a less tedious, but tasty and filling snack after school. A hectic day wouldn’t allow both working parents and homemakers to cook more than three whole meals a day.

This is how the tagline “2 Minute Mein Maggi” was born. We’ve all seen the commercial; it showcases a mother preparing maggi for the kids only to see them delighted by its taste!

Apart from this tactic, Nestlé also reached out to school kids, sponsored quizzes and events and even gave them free hampers of Maggi products. This was followed by a Widespread sampling, with over 4 million new contacts every year. Nestlé also began advertising on TV channels during the peak time, when people like you and me were watching Power Rangers, Dragon Ball Z and Ninja Hathori!

In technical terms, based on socio-economic status, the Indian audience could be categorised into 7 categories ranging from A1 to E2, The top segment consisted of SEC classes A1, A2 and B1, the middle segment was B2 and C and the bottom segment was D E1 E2.

The top and middle segment was already captured by 2005 through their conventional efforts, but they saw that the real opportunity was in SEC classes C and D that represented over 40% of the market.

Lastly, as I have repeatedly said, while good brands sell you a product, great brands sell you an emotion. It even pertains to a simple dry cake of Noodles.

> People might forget what you said but they will never forget how you made them feel!
