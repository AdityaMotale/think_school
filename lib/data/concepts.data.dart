        "The Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people with low ability, knowledge, or expertise in a particular area overestimate their own competence. Conversely, those with high ability often underestimate their competence. This effect results in poor performers being unaware of their own lack of skill and thus overconfident, while skilled individuals might doubt their abilities.",

        "The 'Assembly bonus effect' refers to the improved overall performance or value achieved when individual components or parts are assembled together, exceeding the sum of their separate effects. This synergy occurs because the integrated system optimizes interactions and functions more efficiently, often observed in various fields like manufacturing, technology, and biology, where combined elements work better together than individually.",

Named after Garrison Keillor's fictional town where â€˜all the children are above average,â€™ this effect highlights the tendency for people to rate themselves unrealistically high in areas like intelligence, competence, and attractiveness.",

        "It is an optical illusion where a spoked wheel appears to rotate differently from its actual motion. When viewed under certain conditions, such as in film or under stroboscopic light, the wheel may seem to rotate slowly, backward, or stand still, despite moving forward rapidly. It is caused by the timing of visual snapshots relative to the wheel's position, creating misperceptions of its true motion.",
